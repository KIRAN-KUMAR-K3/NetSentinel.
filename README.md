## ‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**

To set up **NetSentinel**, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python's package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the **NetSentinel** repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIRAN-KUMAR-K3/NetSentinel.git
cd NetSentinel
```

### Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's best to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Application

After installation, you can start monitoring your network traffic by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will start capturing packets and provide detailed logs for each captured packet.

## üìã **How It Works**

1. **Packet Sniffing**: **NetSentinel** uses **Scapy** to sniff and capture network packets in real-time.
2. **Protocol Detection**: Each packet is analyzed to identify its protocol (TCP, UDP, ARP).
3. **Logging**: Detailed packet information is displayed in color-coded logs for better readability.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: **NetSentinel** keeps monitoring until manually stopped, providing ongoing network security analysis.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Example Output**

When **NetSentinel** captures a packet, the following output is displayed:

```
--- Packet Captured ---
Source IP: 192.168.1.1
Destination IP: 192.168.1.100
Protocol: TCP
TCP Source Port: 443
TCP Destination Port: 5020
---------------------------
```
